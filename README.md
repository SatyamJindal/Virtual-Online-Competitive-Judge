# Virtual-Online-Competitive-Judge 


**Virtual Online Judge** generates a random set of questions from various Online Websites for competitive programming  such as Codechef, Codeforces etc.It creates a contest containing five problems sorted by difficulty and a user may submit solutions to these problems in any order. Questions from these websites are scraped and can be viewed by the user on a basic GUI crated on python using Tkinter.


Every competitive programmer wants a good mix of questions from different judges and to have a script which would create a completely random contest any number of times would be a delight for a competitive programmer. :computer:
